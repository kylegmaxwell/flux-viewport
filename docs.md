# Flux Viewport

This is the API reference for the Flux Viewport.

A tutorial is included in the Flux SDK Documentation with the [Flux Seed](https://github.com/flux-labs/flux-seed) project.

The [git book](https://flux.gitbooks.io/flux-javascript-sdk/content/) documenting the Flux JavaScript SDK,
also has a good introduction to using the [Flux Viewport](https://flux.gitbooks.io/flux-javascript-sdk/content/tutorial/Chapter-2.html).

Once you are familiar with the basic usage of FluxViewport, this reference can be used to find the complete list of features.

The easiest place to start is the [Flux Viewport](FluxViewport.html) class.
